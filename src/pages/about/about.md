# Me

[github](https://www.github.com/mimmyjau) [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mimmyjau)

I enjoy reading, learning, and sometimes writing. I like talking to people who are passionate about something niche and unpopular. I like synthesizing ideas and reconciling apparent contradictions.

I have a deep appreciation for art and artists. I think aesthetics is a worthwhile pursuit in and of itself.

I think there's no use in being strong if you aren't good, and there's no use in being good if you aren't strong. We need more moral courage.

I have a lot of respect for people who are lighthearted, focused, compassionate, and authentic.

I think we all have a personal obligation to figure out what it means to self-actualize, and then to do it.

I think the divine is incomprehensible.

Sola gratia.
