# Me

[github](https://www.github.com/mimmyjau) [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mimmyjau)

I'm mostly a generalist.  
I like drawing connections between ideas in different fields.  
I'm happiest when I'm doing something creative.

(and again as a haiku)

a generalist  
ideas bridging different fields  
creativity :)
